Run the `python clean_dataset.py` to generate the version of the data that our models will run.
Then to run an agent use `python main.py --agent=AGENT_NAME` to generate a set of experiments
Run `python plot.py --agent=AGENT_NAME1,AGENT_NAME2` to visualize that agent's performance against the
other agents provided. This automatically generates the named plots in the plots/ directory.
